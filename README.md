# extraterrestrial
github repository for the [extraterrestrial shiny app](https://dylan12899.shinyapps.io/Extraterrestrial/) 

This is a shiny app created for my STat 431 final project at California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo, taught by Dr. Bodwin and Dr. Glanz.

This shiny app was made possible by the kaggle dataset [UFO Sightings](https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings?select=scrubbed.csv).

I hope you have fun exploring my application it is not the heaviest on the statistics side but it has lots of fun things to do!
